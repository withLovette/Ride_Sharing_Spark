# Batch Processing Pipeline for Ride-Sharing Analytics with Apache Spark

## Project Overview
This capstone project aims to build an end-to-end batch processing pipeline that ingests, transforms, and analyzes ride-sharing data using Apache Spark, Python, and SQL. 
The objective is to demonstrate efficient data processing and analytics capabilities on large datasets.

## Project Scope

- The batch processing data pipeline for a ride-sharing service (e.g., Uber, Bolt, or Lyft) will:
- Ingest historical ride data from CSV or JSON files.
- Clean and transform the data using Apache Spark.
- Store the transformed data (optional) in a SQL-based data warehouse.
- Run analytical queries to generate insights on ride trends.
- Visualize the results using Jupyter Notebook, image exports, HTML, or Streamlit.

Tech Stack
Python: Data processing and scripting
SQL: Querying and analytics
Apache Spark: Batch data processing
PostgreSQL / Snowflake (optional): Data storage
Pandas & Matplotlib: Data analysis and visualization
Docker: Containerization for portability

## Project Setup & Execution Steps

Prerequisites
Install Python (>=3.8)
Install Apache Spark (>=3.0)
Install PostgreSQL or Snowflake (if using SQL storage)
Install required Python packages:
! pip install folium
! pip install geopy

Ensure Docker is installed (optional for containerization)


Setup

Clone the repository:

git clone <repository_url>
cd batch-processing-pipeline

Configure database connection (if using SQL storage) in config.py.

Download or generate the sample dataset (rides.csv).

Run the pipeline:

python main.py

(Optional) Run with Docker:

docker build -t batch-pipeline .
docker run batch-pipeline


Key Findings & Insights

Ride Trends
The highest number of rides occur during peak commuting hours (7-9 AM and 5-7 PM).
Weekends show a drop in total ride counts, but an increase in longer trips.

Driver Performance
The top 10% of drivers contribute to approximately 60% of total earnings.
Peak ride hours significantly impact driver revenue, with surge pricing playing a crucial role.

Revenue Analysis
Revenue trends show seasonal variations, with increased earnings during holidays.
Average fare per kilometer varies across cities, with metropolitan areas showing higher rates.

Optimization Opportunities
Implementing dynamic pricing models based on demand can enhance revenue.
Providing incentives for drivers during low-demand hours could balance ride distribution.
